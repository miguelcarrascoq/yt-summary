This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## TODO

- limit the AI request (Google Gemini API)
- select the AI model
- use only free AI models (??)
- remove tooltip. Add message instead
- make more responsive
- change style
- add related/more video links
- add getparam to work (video ID as query param)
- show more info about the video
- add 3 more options: 3 most important points, 5 most important points & a custom prompt (in a modal)
- order voices by language

## FIX

- play/stop status (when finish playing, it should change state)
- Voice in mobile (when no voice found)
